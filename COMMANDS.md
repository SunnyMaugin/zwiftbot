## File Formats

### Key Import File (for /importkeys)

## Notes
- All administrative commands require appropriate permissions
- All responses to administrative commands are ephemeral (only visible to the command user)
- The bot automatically backs up keys before any modifications
- Keys are automatically delivered when a purchase is completed
- Low stock warnings appear when a product has fewer than 10 keys remaining

## Best Practices
1. Regularly check `/keystats` for low stock warnings
2. Use `/keyhistory` to monitor key usage
3. Keep backups of your key files
4. Test new keys with `/searchkeys` before distributing
5. Monitor `/status` for pending orders

## Troubleshooting
- If commands don't appear, use `/sync` or `!sync`
- If keys aren't being delivered, check the key stock with `/checkkeys`
- If you need to restore keys, use `/restorekeys`
- For any issues with orders, use `/status` to check the current state
